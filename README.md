#  FarAwayComparison

![PrototoType 1 Image](Documentation/Resources/ProtoType1Image.png)

## Abstract

This project shows a TDD and MVP approach to making an app which gets data from multiple RESTful API's and congregrates it to show it to the user based on location and a foreign ficitonal planet that reminisces the current weather conditions.
The design is centered around compact simplicity. Compact as it shows a lot of information on the screen at once, simple as its ui consists of symbol and text pairs. The symbols are mostly from Apples SFSymbol collection with a few (obvious) ones designed by me -- I bet you can guess which ones.
Â The 1st prototype gives me a working UI and model to work with and test different comparison models.
